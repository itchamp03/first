                <p>Hi! I'm Yash, a high school student passionate about technology, finance, and creative problem-solving. I love building projects that combine design and logic, and I’m always exploring new tools to bring my ideas to life. Whether I’m coding a web app, leading a robotics team, or diving deep into economics, I enjoy learning and taking on new challenges.

When I’m not at school, you might find me playing cricket, debating, composing music, or trying to beat my personal best at the gym. I'm also deeply interested in investing, thanks to my early exposure to the world of finance.

This website is a small glimpse into what I’ve done so far. Thanks for checking it out!</p>
